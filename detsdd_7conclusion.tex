Since the bulk of the computations are performed in estimating the
residue PLD, it would be interesting to see if this could be bypassed
using better bounds based on the stretch.

Also, even if this algorithm presents a linear bound, it requires
a fairly advanced machinery (ST solvers) that may limit its practicality.
Some heuristic implementation, for example based on algebraic multi-grid
methods, could be a first step in this direction.

The authors are much indebted to Satish Rao and Jim Demmel for suggesting
the original idea and their helpful comments on the draft of this
article.
